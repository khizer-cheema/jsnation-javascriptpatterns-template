/* MVVM -> Model - View - ViewModel
Model â†’ Stores the to-do list data.
ViewModel â†’ Handles all UI logic (event listeners, updating DOM).
View (HTML) â†’ Pure markup, automatically updated when ViewModel changes.

ðŸ”‘ Difference from MVC:
-In MVC, the Controller updates both Model and View explicitly.
-In MVVM, the ViewModel acts as a mediator and binds the Model to the View.
-View â†” ViewModel communicate directly via bindings/events.
